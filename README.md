hello-world
===========

Powerful javascript file which says hello to the **entire world**!

I was playing around with the 6 or so package managers for Javascript and I was
surprised to find that there was no hello world on NPM, so I wrote this one.

If hello.js detects a document object it will replace the body and title with
"hello world" after the onload event occurs.

It will also return "hello world" to the console and it finishes off
by returning "hell world" using an anonymous, self-executing function.

I couldn't think of any other possible features.
